## Setting Up Backend
### Virtual Environment
1. Navigate to `src/server`
2. Run the following command to create the environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Start the virtual environment:
    Unix / Mac OS X: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    Windows w/ Command Prompt: `path\to\venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
